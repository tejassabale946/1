    <p class="paras1">Do you know how powerful Instagram is?

        Many people have now heard of Instagram. It does not matter if you are a tech expert, you know about the latest and greatest apps, or you can't check your email. We can all agree that someone we know lives on Instagram. When you look around these days it is not uncommon to see someone staring at their phone without knowing what is happening around them. Has this ever happened to you, or have you ever done it?
        
        At that time smartphones were not so smart, apps were rare, and people there were not at all bothered by their phones, and more importantly, the apps they used. Today you can use apps like Instagram to chat with friends or mark them on something you've seen, send them a video message, reply to a story they posted, or based on seeing something that reminded you of them. You can also get stuck exploring different cities, watching your favorite character every day in life, or your favorite comedian singing live or captions from the latest night game. None of this happened 15 years ago, at that time people were turning to TV for entertainment but now people are spending more time on their phones than ever before and Instagram is where they spend most of their time. Whether you own a business or want to make a name for yourself ... Instagram is one of the forums you need to use, here's why.
        
        Did you know that on Instagram you get over 800 million users every month. Instagram is growing rapidly across all social media platforms, and with 800 million users it has become one of the best forums for your target audience. And right now, on Instagram, and on Instagram, their phone makes it even more powerful. Look around, you can always find someone staring at their phone, and more importantly using Instagram.
        
        Instagram makes Network easier for you. The ability to connect with the wide range of Instagram that Instagram has given us, is global and incomparable. Wise people like you know that they must use every opportunity to grow and expand their network. Instagram allows you to connect with people based on their interests, location, hash tags and share of friends and contacts. Now this gives you a good reason for all the time you spend on Instagram.</p>
