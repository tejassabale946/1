        <H1>WHY Youtube INTERACTS US ?</H1>
    </div>

    <p class="paras1">The first thing is that YouTube is owned by Google
 
        Like I said. This has amazing implications for YouTube and its future. As you may know, YouTube started out as a non-Google company. In fact, it was only recently that Google bought them.
         
        If you look at Google and what it is about, it is a game to make money. They are interested in making money online. Having a company like Google behind you can only bring you the best of both worlds.
         
        That's one thing. Google has deep pocket-sized packages. They can sponsor a company like YouTube for many years to come if they want to. They decided to support YouTube because they saw the potential in YouTube. That is a clear indication that YouTube is a technology to be considered.
         
         
        Google also wants you to succeed. If you succeed, it will make them richer and more successful. So just because they follow YouTube means they are working hard to make YouTube easier for you to succeed.
         
        If you look at the changes that YouTube has gone through since Google purchased, you can see a big difference. You can see it in the AdSense program presented on YouTube videos. You can see the different designs and structures in which they work. You can see how YouTube videos are better ranked among Google search engines. Having Google on their side is too big.
         
        Rate YouTube videos on Google search results
         
        So  have you something from your's  side. If you posted anything on YouTube, the  chance  of getting a top position on Google are much higher compared to all other video sharing sites available.
         
        It is an Amazing Traffic Source
         
        This is an understatement, but if you look at YouTube, it has just reached one billion views a day. I’m not sure we can think of that number, but just think of a million characters, maybe you’ll be able to fill an entire arena full of coins. One billion views a day is huge, and this is from one website.
         
        In 2008 a study was conducted showing that there are 71 million different users each month. That number has probably changed now, but this is the latest information we have on that particular number. It's a great combination. If you do not use this as a source for traffic production, you are missing out.
         
        I think the example I used, FreeMagicLive, touched on. We have recently scratched a lot and are already sitting with 15,000 people on our email list.
         
        Search Engine Alone
         
        Have you ever been to YouTube and started searching for something, like in the search box right here? More and more people are now using YouTube as their main search engine compared to Google. Is this perhaps a trend that will continue in the future and instead of people just doing a search on Google, just go to YouTube to search? Maybe YouTube will be the # 1 site where people want to search for information.
         
        Think about this. What are the consequences? If YouTube could be the # 1 search engine in the world, what are the results of your online business? 
         
        YouTube is no longer new
         
        This is a question I have had for many people. They say, "Sure, you are successful on YouTube, but only your new market." Now that may have been the case when YouTube started, but now things have changed. YouTube's demographics are changing and changing dramatically. It’s not just for teenagers, so if you’re advertising other age groups, this is good news.
         
        Teens are still very high, but as you will see in some of these figures, YouTube is also suitable for other age groups. Note: 85% of people in the United States watch YouTube videos. That's good. 85% of all United States have watched a YouTube video. This is amazing!
         
        But now, look at this. 71% of men between the ages of 45-54 watch a YouTube video. How cool is that? Here's another thing, look at all these other ages combined. These are the one  who have money. These are one who have jobs and cannot afford to pay for something online. If you include all these people, that is more than just youth.
         
        Check out these percentage of people who have watched YouTube videos in their lives. It's not just new. This is something to keep in mind when considering using YouTube as a potential source of traffic to your website.
         
        YouTube's demographics are changing
         
        It is no longer just for teenagers. As those young people get older, they grow older, they start to get jobs, and they also start to move.</p>
